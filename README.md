# What it does:
* Allows Users to upload their own events, this would include: class, start and end dates, and type (Assignment, Test, etc,).

# How we built it:
* Flutter/Dart - Main Programming Language.
* Table_Calendar - Calendar package, used for displaying events on a calendar.
* Firebase - Used to store data of users, classes, and assignments.

# Challenges we ran into:
* We wanted to make a website first, but that would prove to be difficult given the timeframe and learning curve.
* Planning and implementing a database model to fit the requirements for storing info on students and their classes.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of:
* That we pivoted from website to app half-way through and still managed to create an app while maintaining core features
* A working prototype.
* Getting Firebase to work.

# What we learned:
* Working with databases
* Table_calendar workings
* Flutter / Dart

# What's next for Edu-Plan?
* Make it into a website so that it's more convenient and can be used across any platform.
* Update the UI to make it more appealing to the end user.
* * Add push notifications when a new assignment is added or when there is too much workload in order to notify the educators in a faster and in a more efficient manner.
* Add analytics like total average work per day to be able to better gauge student workload.
* Suggestions on when to schedule assignments.
# Built With
* Flutter
